[dev-dependencies]
#TODO: WITH CARGO AUTHORS: Version here affects version above. This means, this internal dev dependency, when defined with v0.52.0, e.g., makes it impossible for users of this crate to use it with an earlier version of the `windows` crate. (Confirmed with both approaches: when obtaining this crate from crates.io, and when specifying the dependency for this crate with `path = "..."`.)
