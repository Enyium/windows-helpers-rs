A library crate to make working with the [`windows` crate](https://crates.io/crates/windows) a bit easier and more pleasant.

# Feature Requirements

If not instructed to activate more specific features, activate at least the feature that specifies the `windows` crate version you depend on. An example would be the feature name `windows_v0_52`. Not every version is already available (see [`Cargo.toml`](Cargo.toml) to get an idea of the feature names).
